## Users Benefits and Goals

- Product Owner 
    the webssite establishes a powerful tool for knowledge dissemination, networking activities, sharing and acquiring cutting-edge ideas on specific topics

- Final User
    
#### A) For the first-time user
 - dynamic digital platform to contribute to and navigate through the content of book entries 

#### For returning and frequent users

- a reliable source of the latest literature on the specific topic, a place to communicate with colleagues, learn what the scientific community members think on particular issues, or even their books that became part of this project.

## User Experience (UX) Section

### Main Features and Structure  

 **Home Page**

 - The landing area offers an overview of the six titles: title, author, time of entry creation, contributors' identity, and a short resume.
 

![Landing Page](./static/images/landing_area.png)


 - **About page**
 is divided into three sections:

![About Page](./static/images/about_page.png)




 - a: short textual explanation about the purpose of the project 
 - b: The form section allows users to enter and submit bibliographical units in the database. Further development: The "Read" and"Update" buttons will be deleted. The "Delete" button will become functional. *Superuser* and the *author of the entry* will be able to delete db-elements, which should cause the deletion of all reviews related to this specific entry. The "Comment" button will be renamed to the "Review" button, becoming a direct link to the review section.  
 - c: Capture featuring a forest fire - Further development: The Contact form, similar to one presented in "I think Therefore I Blog," will be introduced instad of the existing capture to enhance cooperation with the product owner and allow minor corrections of book entries. More attention will be paid to the style of this page.

[Book Management and Commenting System](https://github.com/VladaAlek/code_institute_django_pp_4 "Book Management and Commenting System"). At its core are these wireframes: 

**Landing Page**

 - **Favicon** *not visible* in Firefox: [06/Aug/2024 08:31:59] "GET /4/ HTTP/1.1" 500 352382
Not Found: /favicon.ico. *Visible* in: Edge and Chrome.
 - deleted bibliographic unit still visible in the list [Not Deleted](static/images/Disaster_Reseach.png);
 - Server Error 500 when attempting to open single book view [Server Error 500](static/images/external%20server%20error.png); 
 The possible cause of problem was detected, but the issue was left unaddressed due to the time scarcity: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46021463/heroku-giving-500-error-with-little-information-internal-server-error  "stackoverflow")

### Testing

- [review submitted testing](static/images/review%20submited%20testing.png); [review submited testing success](static/images/review%20submited%20testing%201.png); explanation: extra code added to target the precise success message. The captures show the initial and end stages of development.

- JavaScript JSLint doesn't support all ESJ features, hence minor error reports [Jslint](static/images/jslint.png). When possible, the raised issues addressed - too long text in the comments;
- Python [Pythonium](https://pythonium.net/linter)

### Further improvement
 - use slugs (book's key-words) instead of object's id to improve the site's ranking in search engines.
